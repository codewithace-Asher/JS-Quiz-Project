<p align="center">In this project, i will walk through the process of creating an interactive quiz game using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The game will present a series of multiple-choice questions to the user, track their answers, and display the final score at the end.

Setting up the HTML:
Start by creating an HTML file (e.g., index.html) that will serve as the foundation of our quiz game. Within the HTML file, you'll need to structure the layout to display the questions, options, and buttons for user interactions.

Designing the Questions:
Decide on the number of questions you want to include in the quiz. For each question, define the question itself and a set of multiple-choice options, along with the correct answer. Store these questions and options in an array of objects, where each object represents a single question.

Linking JavaScript:
Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., script.js) and link it to the HTML file using the script tag. This is where all the logic and functionality for the quiz game will be implemented.

Implementing the Quiz Logic:
a. First, retrieve and store references to the necessary HTML elements (e.g., question container, options, score display, etc.) using JavaScript's DOM manipulation methods like document.getElementById or document.querySelector.

b. Create variables to track the current question number, user's score, and user's selected answers.

c. Write a function that loads the next question and its options onto the screen. Update the question text and option buttons based on the current question number.

d. Implement event listeners for the option buttons so that when the user selects an answer, it's recorded in the user's selected answers.

e. Include a "Submit" button that allows the user to finalize their answers.

Scoring and Results:
a. After the user submits the quiz, calculate the score by comparing the user's selected answers with the correct answers. Award points for each correct answer.
b. Display the user's score along with a feedback message, such as "Congratulations!" for a high score or "Better luck next time!" for a low score.

Styling and User Interface:
Use CSS to style the quiz game, making it visually appealing and user-friendly. Consider using animations or visual cues to provide feedback to the user when they answer questions.

Error Handling:
Incorporate error handling to ensure that the user selects an answer before moving to the next question or submitting the quiz. Display appropriate messages or visual cues to guide the user if they miss any steps.

Play Again Option:
Add a "Play Again" button or feature that allows the user to reset the quiz and start over.

Testing:
Test the quiz game thoroughly, ensuring that all functionalities work as expected and that the user experience is smooth and intuitive.<p><br>
