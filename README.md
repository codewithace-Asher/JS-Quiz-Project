<p align="center">In this project, i will walk through the process of creating an interactive quiz game using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The game will present a series of multiple-choice questions to the user, track their answers, and display the final score at the end.

Setting up the HTML:
Start by creating an HTML file (e.g., index.html) that will serve as the foundation of our quiz game. Within the HTML file, you'll need to structure the layout to display the questions, options, and buttons for user interactions.

Designing the Questions:
Decide on the number of questions you want to include in the quiz. For each question, define the question itself and a set of multiple-choice options, along with the correct answer. Store these questions and options in an array of objects, where each object represents a single question.

Linking JavaScript:
Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., script.js) and link it to the HTML file using the script tag. This is where all the logic and functionality for the quiz game will be implemented.

Implementing the Quiz Logic:
a. First, retrieve and store references to the necessary HTML elements (e.g., question container, options, score display, etc.) using JavaScript's DOM manipulation methods like document.getElementById or document.querySelector.

b. Create variables to track the current question number, user's score, and user's selected answers.

c. Write a function that loads the next question and its options onto the screen. Update the question text and option buttons based on the current question number.

d. Implement event listeners for the option buttons so that when the user selects an answer, it's recorded in the user's selected answers.

e. Included auto progress final score /results.

Scoring and Results:
a. Auto submit with circular/pie progressive chart with total number of question right/wrong.


Styling and User Interface:
Use CSS to style the quiz game, making it visually appealing and user-friendly. Consider using animations or visual cues to provide feedback to the user when they answer questions.

Error Handling:
Incorporated an auto show of correct answer using function optionSelected see below :



Play Again Option:
Implemeted a "Start Again Button" to start Quiz again.

Testing:
Test the quiz game thoroughly, ensuring that all functionalities work as expected and that the user experience is smooth and intuitive.<p><br>
